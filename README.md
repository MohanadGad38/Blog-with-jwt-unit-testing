# FastAPI Project for Blogs Website

This project is a REST API for a blogs website, developed using FastAPI. It incorporates modern development practices and tools to ensure robust and efficient performance. Below are the key aspects of the project:

### Environment
- **Poetry**: Used as the package manager to manage dependencies and virtual environments.

### Database
- **ORM with SQLAlchemy**: Creating and managing the database using SQLAlchemy ORM for seamless interaction with the database.

### API Development
- **FastAPI**: Building the REST API endpoints.
- **Status Codes and HTTPExceptions**: Handling responses and errors effectively.
- **Repository Design Pattern**: Implementing the repository design pattern to abstract data access logic and ensure separation of concerns.
- **Routes**: Defining and organizing API routes for different functionalities.

### Authentication
- **JWT**: Implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication, using Bearer token type for secure communication.
- **OAuth2**: Integrating OAuth2 for enhanced authentication mechanisms and third-party service integration.

### Async Operations
- **Async I/O**: Utilizing asynchronous programming for I/O operations to enhance performance and responsiveness.

### Containerization
- **Docker**: Containerizing the application using Docker for consistent environments across development, testing, and production stages.

### Testing
- **Pytest**: Writing test functions using pytest.
- **Mock DB**: Creating test cases for the blogs with a mock database to ensure the correctness of the application.

## To-Do List
1. **Change Database Engine**: Transition the database engine from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
2. **Database Migration Tool**: Use Alembic for database migrations.
3. **Separate Databases**: Create two separate databases, one for production and one for testing, with the help of Alembic.
4. **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Continue developing unit tests for all functions using the test database instead of a mock database.

This project leverages the power of FastAPI for building high-performance APIs, SQLAlchemy for robust database interactions, and Docker for efficient deployment and scaling. The use of Poetry ensures smooth dependency management, and pytest provides a reliable framework for testing the application. The to-do list outlines the next steps to enhance the project's database handling and testing strategies.
